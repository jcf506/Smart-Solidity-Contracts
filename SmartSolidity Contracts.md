These contracts are designed to create efficiency and security in the allocation of
compensatory provisions. The Associate Profit Splitter facillitates the distribution of
company profits sending the remainder back to the human resources department, that is charged with 
that task.  Based on the weight of the employees value to the organization,
the CEO gets the remainders of undistributed wei (the denomination of ether cryptocurrency coin)
per the Tiered Profit Splitter contract.

Also built in, are the safeguards that ensure the discreet delivery of the company equity in the
compensation package to each designee, as well as enforcement of the vested time requirements 
that underpin the disbusrsements. The contract for the Deferred Equity Plan requires that only an authorized 
employee - with deference to a human resources team member - can execute the contract.
